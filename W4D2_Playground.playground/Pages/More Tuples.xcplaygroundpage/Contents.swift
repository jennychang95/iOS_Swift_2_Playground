 ## More Tuples
 We already know switch statements can evaluate some value and tries to match it up with a case provided.
 The value that switch statements evaluate can also be a tuple!
 The switch statement evaluates each value of the tuple individually and tries to find a match in the provided cases.

 Imagine we are rolling two six-sided dice. We can use a tuple to represent each of the dice values.

 - Experiment:
 Use the below switch statement to test the following cases. What do they do? Try changing the value of `diceRoll` to see what happens!
 - case (_, 1)
 - case (2, _)
 - case (1...3, 1...3)
 - case (let x, let y) where x == y
